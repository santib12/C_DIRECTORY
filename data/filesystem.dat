This hook is to be used to override the default\n# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour\n# as a starting point for convenient modification.\n#\n# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current\n# branch is going to be updated:\ncommit=$1\n\n# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does\n# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).\ndie () {\n	echo >&2 "$*"\n	exit 1\n}\n\n# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the\n# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current\n# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.\n#\n# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"\n# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction\n# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is\n# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches\n# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do\n# not interfere with the difference between the branches.\n\n# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code\n# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in\n# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.\n#\n# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,\n# not from the worki

FILE:README.md|# 2D-to-3D-pants-model\r\n\r\n## Project Overview\r\nThis project aims to develop an AI model that converts 2D images of isolated garments (specifically pants) into 3D models. The focus is on training and evaluating models using cropped images of pants, with the goal of generating accurate 3D reconstructions for individual clothing items. The project will start by leveraging existing state-of-the-art solutions and progress toward custom or fine-tuned models.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Project Structure\r\n\r\nThe following folder structure has been created to organize the project:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2D-to-3D-pants-model/\r\n‚îÇ\r\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                # Datasets: 2D images and 3D models (isolated pants)\r\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/          # Cropped images of pants for training/testing\r\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ models/          # Corresponding 3D models (e.g., .obj, .ply)\r\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks for experiments and prototyping\r\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                 # Source code for model, training, and utilities\r\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pretrained_models/   # Downloaded or fine-tuned existing models\r\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs/             # Generated 3D models and visualizations\r\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pifuhd/              # PIFuHD model and scripts\r\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies\r\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # Project documentation\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Running PIFuHD on Custom Images\r\n\r\n1. **Prepare your images:**\r\n   - Place your cropped pants images in `pifuhd/sample_images/`.\r\n   - Images should be in `.png` or `.jpg` format (lowercase extensions are safest).\r\n   - Images must be exactly **512x512 pixels**.\r\n   - Remove any non-image or hidden files from the folder.\r\n\r\n2. **Activate your virtual environment:**\r\n   - In your terminal, from the project root:\r\n     - Git Bash: `source venv/Scripts/activate`\r\n     - Command Prompt: `venv\Scripts\activate`\r\n\r\n3. **Run the inference from inside the `pifuhd` directory:**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   cd pifuhd\r\n   python -m

FILE:README.md|# ESLintRC Library\n\nThis repository contains the legacy ESLintRC configuration file format for ESLint. This package is not intended for use outside of the ESLint ecosystem. It is ESLint-specific and not intended for use in other programs.\n\n**Note:** This package is frozen except for critical bug fixes as ESLint moves to a new config system.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install the package as follows:\n\n```\nnpm install @eslint/eslintrc --save-dev\n\n# or\n\nyarn add @eslint/eslintrc -D\n```\n\n## Usage (ESM)\n\nThe primary class in this package is `FlatCompat`, which is a utility to translate ESLintRC-style configs into flat configs. Here's how you use it inside of your `eslint.config.js` file:\n\n```js\nimport { FlatCompat } from "@eslint/eslintrc";\nimport js from "@eslint/js";\nimport path from "path";\nimport { fileURLToPath } from "url";\n\n// mimic CommonJS variables -- not needed if using CommonJS\nconst __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);\nconst __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);\n\nconst compat = new FlatCompat({\n    baseDirectory: __dirname,                  // optional; default: process.cwd()\n    resolvePluginsRelativeTo: __dirname,       // optional\n    recommendedConfig: js.configs.recommended, // optional\n    allConfig: js.configs.all,                 // optional\n});\n\nexport default [\n\n    // mimic ESLintRC-style extends\n    ...compat.extends("standard", "example"),\n\n    // mimic environments\n    ...compat.env({\n        es2020: true,\n        node: true\n    }),\n\n    // mimic plugins\n    ...compat.plugins("airbnb", "react"),\n\n    // translate an entire config\n    ...compat.config({\n        plugins: ["airbnb", "react"],\n        extends: "standard",\n        env: {\n            es2020: true,\n            node: true\n        },\n        rules: {\n            semi: "error"\n        }\n    })\n];\n```\n\n## Usage (CommonJS)\n\nUsing `FlatCompat` in CommonJS files is similar to ESM, but you'll use `require()` and `module.exports` instead of `import` and `export`. H
FILE:universal.js|// Jest (and probably some other runtimes with custom implementations of\n// `require`) doesn't support `exports` in `package.json`, so this file is here\n// to help them load this module. Note that it is also `.js` and not `.cjs` for\n// the same reason - `cjs` files requires to be loaded with an extension, but\n// since Jest doesn't respect `module` outside of ESM mode it still works in\n// this case (and the `require` in _this_ file does specify the extension).\n\n// eslint-disable-next-line no-undef\nmodule.exports = require("./dist/eslintrc-universal.cjs");\n

FILE:README.md|# ModuleImporter\n\nby [Nicholas C. Zakas](https://humanwhocodes.com)\n\nIf you find this useful, please consider supporting my work with a [donation](https://humanwhocodes.com/donate).\n\n## Description\n\nA utility for seamlessly importing modules in Node.js regardless if they are CommonJS or ESM format. Under the hood, this uses `import()` and relies on Node.js's CommonJS compatibility to work correctly. This ensures that the correct locations and formats are used for CommonJS so you can call one method and not worry about any compatibility issues.\n\nThe problem with the default `import()` is that it always resolves relative to the file location in which it is called. If you want to resolve from a different location, you need to jump through a few hoops to achieve that. This package makes it easy to both resolve and import modules from any directory.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Node.js\n\nInstall using [npm][npm] or [yarn][yarn]:\n\n```\nnpm install @humanwhocodes/module-importer\n\n# or\n\nyarn add @humanwhocodes/module-importer\n```\n\nImport into your Node.js project:\n\n```js\n// CommonJS\nconst { ModuleImporter } = require("@humanwhocodes/module-importer");\n\n// ESM\nimport { ModuleImporter } from "@humanwhocodes/module-importer";\n```\n\n### Bun\n\nInstall using this command:\n\n```\nbun add @humanwhocodes/module-importer\n```\n\nImport into your Bun project:\n\n```js\nimport { ModuleImporter } from "@humanwhocodes/module-importer";\n```\n\n## API\n\nAfter importing, create a new instance of `ModuleImporter` to start emitting events:\n\n```js\n// cwd can be omitted to use process.cwd()\nconst importer = new ModuleImporter(cwd);\n\n// you can resolve the location of any package\nconst location = importer.resolve("./some-file.cjs");\n\n// you can also import directly\nconst module = importer.import("./some-file.cjs");\n```\n\nFor both `resolve()` and `import()`, you can pass in package names and filenames.\n\n## Developer Setup\n\n1. Fork the repository\n2. Clone your fork\n3. Run `npm install` to setup dependen

FILE:README.md|# @jridgewell/gen-mapping\n\n> Generate source maps\n\n`gen-mapping` allows you to generate a source map during transpilation or minification.\nWith a source map, you're able to trace the original location in the source file, either in Chrome's\nDevTools or using a library like [`@jridgewell/trace-mapping`][trace-mapping].\n\nYou may already be familiar with the [`source-map`][source-map] package's `SourceMapGenerator`. This\nprovides the same `addMapping` and `setSourceContent` API.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install @jridgewell/gen-mapping\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```typescript\nimport { GenMapping, addMapping, setSourceContent, toEncodedMap, toDecodedMap } from '@jridgewell/gen-mapping';\n\nconst map = new GenMapping({\n  file: 'output.js',\n  sourceRoot: 'https://example.com/',\n});\n\nsetSourceContent(map, 'input.js', `function foo() {}`);\n\naddMapping(map, {\n  // Lines start at line 1, columns at column 0.\n  generated: { line: 1, column: 0 },\n  source: 'input.js',\n  original: { line: 1, column: 0 },\n});\n\naddMapping(map, {\n  generated: { line: 1, column: 9 },\n  source: 'input.js',\n  original: { line: 1, column: 9 },\n  name: 'foo',\n});\n\nassert.deepEqual(toDecodedMap(map), {\n  version: 3,\n  file: 'output.js',\n  names: ['foo'],\n  sourceRoot: 'https://example.com/',\n  sources: ['input.js'],\n  sourcesContent: ['function foo() {}'],\n  mappings: [\n    [ [0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 9, 0] ]\n  ],\n});\n\nassert.deepEqual(toEncodedMap(map), {\n  version: 3,\n  file: 'output.js',\n  names: ['foo'],\n  sourceRoot: 'https://example.com/',\n  sources: ['input.js'],\n  sourcesContent: ['function foo() {}'],\n  mappings: 'AAAA,SAASA',\n});\n```\n\n### Smaller Sourcemaps\n\nNot everything needs to be added to a sourcemap, and needless markings can cause signficantly\nlarger file sizes. `gen-mapping` exposes `maybeAddSegment`/`maybeAddMapping` APIs that will\nintelligently determine if this marking adds useful information.

FILE:README.md|# @jridgewell/remapping\n\n> Remap sequential sourcemaps through transformations to point at the original source code\n\nRemapping allows you to take the sourcemaps generated through transforming your code and "remap"\nthem to the original source locations. Think "my minified code, transformed with babel and bundled\nwith webpack", all pointing to the correct location in your original source code.\n\nWith remapping, none of your source code transformations need to be aware of the input's sourcemap,\nthey only need to generate an output sourcemap. This greatly simplifies building custom\ntransformations (think a find-and-replace).\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install @jridgewell/remapping\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```typescript\nfunction remapping(\n  map: SourceMap \| SourceMap[],\n  loader: (file: string, ctx: LoaderContext) => (SourceMap \| null \| undefined),\n  options?: { excludeContent: boolean, decodedMappings: boolean }\n): SourceMap;\n\n// LoaderContext gives the loader the importing sourcemap, tree depth, the ability to override the\n// "source" location (where child sources are resolved relative to, or the location of original\n// source), and the ability to override the "content" of an original source for inclusion in the\n// output sourcemap.\ntype LoaderContext = {\n readonly importer: string;\n readonly depth: number;\n source: string;\n content: string \| null \| undefined;\n}\n```\n\n`remapping` takes the final output sourcemap, and a `loader` function. For every source file pointer\nin the sourcemap, the `loader` will be called with the resolved path. If the path itself represents\na transformed file (it has a sourcmap associated with it), then the `loader` should return that\nsourcemap. If not, the path will be treated as an original, untransformed source code.\n\n```js\n// Babel transformed "helloworld.js" into "transformed.js"\nconst transformedMap = JSON.stringify({\n  file: 'transformed.js',\n  // 1st column of 2nd line of output file translates into the 1st source\n  // file, line 3, column

FILE:README.md|# @jridgewell/sourcemap-codec\n\nEncode/decode the `mappings` property of a [sourcemap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit).\n\n\n## Why?\n\nSourcemaps are difficult to generate and manipulate, because the `mappings` property ‚Äì the part that actually links the generated code back to the original source ‚Äì is encoded using an obscure method called [Variable-length quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity). On top of that, each segment in the mapping contains offsets rather than absolute indices, which means that you can't look at a segment in isolation ‚Äì you have to understand the whole sourcemap.\n\nThis package makes the process slightly easier.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install @jridgewell/sourcemap-codec\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport { encode, decode } from '@jridgewell/sourcemap-codec';\n\nvar decoded = decode( ';EAEEA,EAAE,EAAC,CAAE;ECQY,UACC' );\n\nassert.deepEqual( decoded, [\n	// the first line (of the generated code) has no mappings,\n	// as shown by the starting semi-colon (which separates lines)\n	[],\n\n	// the second line contains four (comma-separated) segments\n	[\n		// segments are encoded as you'd expect:\n		// [ generatedCodeColumn, sourceIndex, sourceCodeLine, sourceCodeColumn, nameIndex ]\n\n		// i.e. the first segment begins at column 2, and maps back to the second column\n		// of the second line (both zero-based) of the 0th source, and uses the 0th\n		// name in the `map.names` array\n		[ 2, 0, 2, 2, 0 ],\n\n		// the remaining segments are 4-length rather than 5-length,\n		// because they don't map a name\n		[ 4, 0, 2, 4 ],\n		[ 6, 0, 2, 5 ],\n		[ 7, 0, 2, 7 ]\n	],\n\n	// the final line contains two segments\n	[\n		[ 2, 1, 10, 19 ],\n		[ 12, 1, 11, 20 ]\n	]\n]);\n\nvar encoded = encode( decoded );\nassert.equal( encoded, ';EAEEA,EAAE,EAAC,CAAE;ECQY,UACC' );\n```\n\n## Benchmarks\n\n```\nnode v20.10.0\n\namp.js.map - 45120 segments\n\nDecode Memory Usage:\nlocal code                             58

FILE:README.md|# @nodelib/fs.scandir\n\n> List files and directories inside the specified directory.\n\n## :bulb: Highlights\n\nThe package is aimed at obtaining information about entries in the directory.\n\n* :moneybag: Returns useful information: `name`, `path`, `dirent` and `stats` (optional).\n* :gear: On Node.js 10.10+ uses the mechanism without additional calls to determine the entry type. See [`old` and `modern` mode](#old-and-modern-mode).\n* :link: Can safely work with broken symbolic links.\n\n## Install\n\n```console\nnpm install @nodelib/fs.scandir\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```ts\nimport * as fsScandir from '@nodelib/fs.scandir';\n\nfsScandir.scandir('path', (error, stats) => { /* ‚Ä¶ */ });\n```\n\n## API\n\n### .scandir(path, [optionsOrSettings], callback)\n\nReturns an array of plain objects ([`Entry`](#entry)) with information about entry for provided path with standard callback-style.\n\n```ts\nfsScandir.scandir('path', (error, entries) => { /* ‚Ä¶ */ });\nfsScandir.scandir('path', {}, (error, entries) => { /* ‚Ä¶ */ });\nfsScandir.scandir('path', new fsScandir.Settings(), (error, entries) => { /* ‚Ä¶ */ });\n```\n\n### .scandirSync(path, [optionsOrSettings])\n\nReturns an array of plain objects ([`Entry`](#entry)) with information about entry for provided path.\n\n```ts\nconst entries = fsScandir.scandirSync('path');\nconst entries = fsScandir.scandirSync('path', {});\nconst entries = fsScandir.scandirSync(('path', new fsScandir.Settings());\n```\n\n#### path\n\n* Required: `true`\n* Type: `string \| Buffer \| URL`\n\nA path to a file. If a URL is provided, it must use the `file:` protocol.\n\n#### optionsOrSettings\n\n* Required: `false`\n* Type: `Options \| Settings`\n* Default: An instance of `Settings` class\n\nAn [`Options`](#options) object or an instance of [`Settings`](#settingsoptions) class.\n\n> :book: When you pass a plain object, an instance of the `Settings` class will be created automatically. If you plan to call the method frequently, use a pre-created instance of the `Settings` class.\n\n### Setti

FILE:README.md|# Remix Router\n\nThe `@remix-run/router` package is a framework-agnostic routing package (sometimes referred to as a browser-emulator) that serves as the heart of [React Router][react-router] and [Remix][remix] and provides all the core functionality for routing coupled with data loading and data mutations. It comes with built-in handling of errors, race-conditions, interruptions, cancellations, lazy-loading data, and much, much more.\n\nIf you're using React Router, you should never `import` anything directly from the `@remix-run/router` - you should have everything you need in `react-router-dom` (or `react-router`/`react-router-native` if you're not rendering in the browser). All of those packages should re-export everything you would otherwise need from `@remix-run/router`.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> This router is a low-level package intended to be consumed by UI layer routing libraries. You should very likely not be using this package directly unless you are authoring a routing library such as [`react-router-dom`][react-router-repo] or one of it's other [UI ports][remix-routers-repo].\n\n## API\n\nA Router instance can be created using `createRouter`:\n\n```js\n// Create and initialize a router.  "initialize" contains all side effects\n// including history listeners and kicking off the initial data fetch\nlet router = createRouter({\n  // Required properties\n  routes: [{\n    path: '/',\n    loader: ({ request, params }) => { /* ... */ },\n    children: [{\n      path: 'home',\n      loader: ({ request, params }) => { /* ... */ },\n    }]\n  },\n  history: createBrowserHistory(),\n\n  // Optional properties\n  basename, // Base path\n  mapRouteProperties, // Map framework-agnostic routes to framework-aware routes\n  future, // Future flags\n  hydrationData, // Hydration data if using server-side-rendering\n}).initialize();\n```\n\nInternally, the Router represents the state in an object of the following format, which is available through `router.state`. You can also register a subscriber of the signature `(sta

FILE:README.md|# @vitejs/plugin-react [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@vitejs/plugin-react.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/@vitejs/plugin-react)\n\nThe default Vite plugin for React projects.\n\n- enable [Fast Refresh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-refresh) in development (requires react >= 16.9)\n- use the [automatic JSX runtime](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html)\n- use custom Babel plugins/presets\n- small installation size\n\n```js\n// vite.config.js\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react()],\n})\n```\n\n## Options\n\n### include/exclude\n\nIncludes `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts` & `.tsx` by default. This option can be used to add fast refresh to `.mdx` files:\n\n```js\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'\nimport mdx from '@mdx-js/rollup'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    { enforce: 'pre', ...mdx() },\n    react({ include: /\.(mdx\|js\|jsx\|ts\|tsx)$/ }),\n  ],\n})\n```\n\n> `node_modules` are never processed by this plugin (but esbuild will)\n\n### jsxImportSource\n\nControl where the JSX factory is imported from. Default to `'react'`\n\n```js\nreact({ jsxImportSource: '@emotion/react' })\n```\n\n### jsxRuntime\n\nBy default, the plugin uses the [automatic JSX runtime](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html). However, if you encounter any issues, you may opt out using the `jsxRuntime` option.\n\n```js\nreact({ jsxRuntime: 'classic' })\n```\n\n### babel\n\nThe `babel` option lets you add plugins, presets, and [other configuration](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/options) to the Babel transformation performed on each included file.\n\n```js\nreact({\n  babel: {\n    presets: [...],\n    // Your plugins run before any built-in transform (eg: Fast Refresh)\n    plugins: [...],\n    // Use .babelrc files\n    babelrc: true,\n    // Use babel.config.js files\n    configFile: true,\n  }\n})\n``

FILE:README.md|# Acorn-JSX\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/acornjs/acorn-jsx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/acornjs/acorn-jsx)\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/acorn-jsx.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/acorn-jsx)\n\nThis is plugin for [Acorn](http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/acorn/) - a tiny, fast JavaScript parser, written completely in JavaScript.\n\nIt was created as an experimental alternative, faster [React.js JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) parser. Later, it replaced the [official parser](https://github.com/facebookarchive/esprima) and these days is used by many prominent development tools.\n\n## Transpiler\n\nPlease note that this tool only parses source code to JSX AST, which is useful for various language tools and services. If you want to transpile your code to regular ES5-compliant JavaScript with source map, check out [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Buble](https://buble.surge.sh/) transpilers which use `acorn-jsx` under the hood.\n\n## Usage\n\nRequiring this module provides you with an Acorn plugin that you can use like this:\n\n```javascript\nvar acorn = require("acorn");\nvar jsx = require("acorn-jsx");\nacorn.Parser.extend(jsx()).parse("my(<jsx/>, 'code');");\n```\n\nNote that official spec doesn't support mix of XML namespaces and object-style access in tag names (#27) like in `<namespace:Object.Property />`, so it was deprecated in `acorn-jsx@3.0`. If you still want to opt-in to support of such constructions, you can pass the following option:\n\n```javascript\nacorn.Parser.extend(jsx({ allowNamespacedObjects: true }))\n```\n\nAlso, since most apps use pure React transformer, a new option was introduced that allows to prohibit namespaces completely:\n\n```javascript\nacorn.Parser.extend(jsx({ allowNamespaces: false }))\n```\n\nNote that by default `allowNamespaces` is enabled for spec compliancy.\n\n## License\n\nThis plugin is issued under the [MIT license](./LICENSE).\n

We test for both standard and non-standard codes, as most of them follow the same or similar format and can be safely matched in strings without the risk of removing actual string content. There are a few non-standard control codes that do not follow the traditional format (i.e. they end in numbers) thus forcing us to exclude them from the test because we cannot reliably match them.\n\nOn the historical side, those ECMA standards were established in the early 90's whereas the VT100, for example, was designed in the mid/late 70's. At that point in time, control codes were still pretty ungoverned and engineers used them for a multitude of things, namely to activate hardware ports that may have been proprietary. Somewhere else you see a similar 'anarchy' of codes is in the x86 architecture for processors; there are a ton of "interrupts" that can mean different things on certain brands of processors, most of

FILE:README.md|argparse\n========\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/nodeca/argparse.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/nodeca/argparse)\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/argparse.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/argparse)\n\nCLI arguments parser for node.js, with [sub-commands](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/argparse.html#sub-commands) support. Port of python's [argparse](http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html) (version [3.9.0](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.9.0rc1/Lib/argparse.py)).\n\n**Difference with original.**\n\n- JS has no keyword arguments support.\n  -  Pass options instead: `new ArgumentParser({ description: 'example', add_help: true })`.\n- JS has no python's types `int`, `float`, ...\n  - Use string-typed names: `.add_argument('-b', { type: 'int', help: 'help' })`.\n- `%r` format specifier uses `require('util').inspect()`.\n\nMore details in [doc](./doc).\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\n`test.js` file:\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n'use strict';\n\nconst { ArgumentParser } = require('argparse');\nconst { version } = require('./package.json');\n\nconst parser = new ArgumentParser({\n  description: 'Argparse example'\n});\n\nparser.add_argument('-v', '--version', { action: 'version', version });\nparser.add_argument('-f', '--foo', { help: 'foo bar' });\nparser.add_argument('-b', '--bar', { help: 'bar foo' });\nparser.add_argument('--baz', { help: 'baz bar' });\n\nconsole.dir(parser.parse_args());\n```\n\nDisplay help:\n\n```\n$ ./test.js -h\nusage: test.js [-h] [-v] [-f FOO] [-b BAR] [--baz BAZ]\n\nArgparse example\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help         show this help message and exit\n  -v, --version      show program's version number and exit\n  -f FOO, --foo FOO  foo bar\n  -b BAR, --bar BAR  bar foo\n  --baz BAZ          baz bar\n```\n\nParse arguments:\n\n```\n$ ./test.js -f=3 --bar=4 --baz 5\n{ foo: '3', bar: '4', baz: '5' }\n```\n\n\nAPI docs\n--------\n\nSince this is a port with minimal divergence, there's no separate documentation.\nUse

FILE:readme.md|# callsites [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/callsites.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/callsites)\n\n> Get callsites from the [V8 stack trace API](https://v8.dev/docs/stack-trace-api)\n\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install callsites\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst callsites = require('callsites');\n\nfunction unicorn() {\n	console.log(callsites()[0].getFileName());\n	//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/dev/callsites/test.js'\n}\n\nunicorn();\n```\n\n\n## API\n\nReturns an array of callsite objects with the following methods:\n\n- `getThis`: returns the value of `this`.\n- `getTypeName`: returns the type of `this` as a string. This is the name of the function stored in the constructor field of `this`, if available, otherwise the object's `[[Class]]` internal property.\n- `getFunction`: returns the current function.\n- `getFunctionName`: returns the name of the current function, typically its `name` property. If a name property is not available an attempt will be made to try to infer a name from the function's context.\n- `getMethodName`: returns the name of the property of `this` or one of its prototypes that holds the current function.\n- `getFileName`: if this function was defined in a script returns the name of the script.\n- `getLineNumber`: if this function was defined in a script returns the current line number.\n- `getColumnNumber`: if this function was defined in a script returns the current column number\n- `getEvalOrigin`: if this function was created using a call to `eval` returns a string representing the location where `eval` was called.\n- `isToplevel`: is this a top-level invocation, that is, is this the global object?\n- `isEval`: does this call take place in code defined by a call to `eval`?\n- `isNative`: is this call in native V8 code?\n- `isConstructor`: is this a constructor call?\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT ¬© [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com)\n

FILE:README.md|# color-convert\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Qix-/color-convert.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Qix-/color-convert)\n\nColor-convert is a color conversion library for JavaScript and node.\nIt converts all ways between `rgb`, `hsl`, `hsv`, `hwb`, `cmyk`, `ansi`, `ansi16`, `hex` strings, and CSS `keyword`s (will round to closest):\n\n```js\nvar convert = require('color-convert');\n\nconvert.rgb.hsl(140, 200, 100);             // [96, 48, 59]\nconvert.keyword.rgb('blue');                // [0, 0, 255]\n\nvar rgbChannels = convert.rgb.channels;     // 3\nvar cmykChannels = convert.cmyk.channels;   // 4\nvar ansiChannels = convert.ansi16.channels; // 1\n```\n\n# Install\n\n```console\n$ npm install color-convert\n```\n\n# API\n\nSimply get the property of the _from_ and _to_ conversion that you're looking for.\n\nAll functions have a rounded and unrounded variant. By default, return values are rounded. To get the unrounded (raw) results, simply tack on `.raw` to the function.\n\nAll 'from' functions have a hidden property called `.channels` that indicates the number of channels the function expects (not including alpha).\n\n```js\nvar convert = require('color-convert');\n\n// Hex to LAB\nconvert.hex.lab('DEADBF');         // [ 76, 21, -2 ]\nconvert.hex.lab.raw('DEADBF');     // [ 75.56213190997677, 20.653827952644754, -2.290532499330533 ]\n\n// RGB to CMYK\nconvert.rgb.cmyk(167, 255, 4);     // [ 35, 0, 98, 0 ]\nconvert.rgb.cmyk.raw(167, 255, 4); // [ 34.509803921568626, 0, 98.43137254901961, 0 ]\n```\n\n### Arrays\nAll functions that accept multiple arguments also support passing an array.\n\nNote that this does **not** apply to functions that convert from a color that only requires one value (e.g. `keyword`, `ansi256`, `hex`, etc.)\n\n```js\nvar convert = require('color-convert');\n\nconvert.rgb.hex(123, 45, 67);      // '7B2D43'\nconvert.rgb.hex([123, 45, 67]);    // '7B2D43'\n```\n\n## Routing\n\nConversions that don't have an _explicitly_ defined conversion (in [conversions.js](conversions

However, this made the library limited to nodejs environments and broke on sources with querystrings.\n\nIn v2.0.0, you now need to pass a function that does the file reading. It will receive the source filename as a String that you can resolve to a filesystem path, URL, or anything else.\n\nIf you are using `convert-source-map` in nodejs and want the previous behavior, you'll use a function like such:\n\n```diff\n+ var fs = require('fs'); // Import the fs module to read a file\n+ var path = require('path'); // Import the path module to resolve a path against your directory\n- var conv = convert.fromMapFileSource(css, '../my-dir');\n+ var conv = convert.fromMapFileSource(css, function (filename) {\n+   return fs.readFileSync(path.resolve('../my-dir', filename), 'utf-8');\n+ });\n```\n\n##

The available options are:\n\n* `unwrap` - set to `true` to delete the leading `/**`, any `*` that begins a line, and the trailing `*/` from the source text. Default: `false`.\n* `tags` - an array of tags to return. When specified, Doctrine returns only tags in this array. For example, if `tags` is `["param"]`, then only `@param` tags will be returned. Default: `null`.\n* `recoverable` - set to `true` to keep parsing even when syntax errors occur. Default: `false`.\n* `sloppy` - set to `true` to allow optional parameters to be specified in brackets (`@param {string} [foo]`). Default: `false`.\n* `lineNumbers` - set to `true` to add `lineNumber` to each node, specifying the line on which the node is found in the source. Default: `false`.\n* `range` - set to `true` to add `range` to each node, specifying the start and end index of the node in the original comment. Default: `false`.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```js\nvar ast = doctrine.parse(\n    [\n        "/**",\n        " * This function comme

Please see [Deno Usage](#deno) below.\n\n---\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install --save escalade\n```\n\n\n## Modes\n\nThere are two "versions" of `escalade` available:\n\n#### "async"\n> **Node.js:** >= 8.x<br>\n> **Size (gzip):** 210 bytes<br>\n> **Availability:** [CommonJS](https://unpkg.com/escalade/dist/index.js), [ES Module](https://unpkg.com/escalade/dist/index.mjs)\n\nThis is the primary/default mode. It makes use of `async`/`await` and [`util.promisify`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_promisify_original).\n\n#### "sync"\n> **Node.js:** >= 6.x<br>\n> **Size (gzip):** 183 bytes<br>\n> **Availability:** [CommonJS](https://unpkg.com/escalade/sync/index.js), [ES Module](https://unpkg.com/escalade/sync/index.mjs)\n\nThis is the opt-in mode, ideal for scenarios where `async` usage cannot be supported.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n***Example Structure***\n\n```\n/Users/lukeed\n  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ oss\n    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ license\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ escalade\n      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json\n      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test\n        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fixtures\n          ‚îú

FILE:README.md|# `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`\n\nThis ESLint plugin enforces the [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html).\n\nIt is a part of the [Hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) for React.\n\n## Installation\n\n**Note: If you're using Create React App, please use `react-scripts` >= 3 instead of adding it directly.**\n\nAssuming you already have ESLint installed, run:\n\n```sh\n# npm\nnpm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev\n\n# yarn\nyarn add eslint-plugin-react-hooks --dev\n```\n\nThen extend the recommended eslint config:\n\n```js\n{\n  "extends": [\n    // ...\n    "plugin:react-hooks/recommended"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Configuration\n\nIf you want more fine-grained configuration, you can instead add a snippet like this to your ESLint configuration file:\n\n```js\n{\n  "plugins": [\n    // ...\n    "react-hooks"\n  ],\n  "rules": {\n    // ...\n    "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error",\n    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## Advanced Configuration\n\n`exhaustive-deps` can be configured to validate dependencies of custom Hooks with the `additionalHooks` option.\nThis option accepts a regex to match the names of custom Hooks that have dependencies.\n\n```js\n{\n  "rules": {\n    // ...\n    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": ["warn", {\n      "additionalHooks": "(useMyCustomHook\|useMyOtherCustomHook)"\n    }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe suggest to use this option **very sparingly, if at all**. Generally saying, we recommend most custom Hooks to not use the dependencies argument, and instead provide a higher-level API that is more focused around a specific use case.\n\n## Valid and Invalid Examples\n\nPlease refer to the [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) documentation and the [Hooks FAQ](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#what-exactly-do-the-lint-rules-enforce) to learn more about this rule.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n

See [Options](#options) to run on JS files. ‚ö†Ô∏è\n\nThe plugin relies on naming conventions (i.e. use PascalCase for components, camelCase for util functions). This is why there are some limitations:\n\n- `export *` are not supported and will be reported as an error\n- Anonymous function are not supported (i.e `export default function() {}`)\n- Class components are not supported\n- All-uppercase function export is considered an error when not using direct named export (ex `const CMS = () => <></>; export { CMS }`)\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm i -D eslint-plugin-react-refresh\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThis plugin provides a single rule, `react-refresh/only-export-components`. There are multiple ways to enable it.\n\n### Recommended config\n\n```js\nimport reactRefresh from "eslint-plugin-react-refresh";\n\nexport default [\n  /* Main config */\n  reactRefresh.configs.recommended,\n];\n```\n\n### Vite config\n\nThis enables the `allowConstantExport` option which is supported by Vite React plugins.\n\n```js\nimport reactRefresh from "eslint-plugin-react-refresh";\n\nexport default [\n  /* Main config */\n  reactRefresh.configs.vite,\n];\n```\n\n### Without config\n\n```js\nimport reactRefresh from "eslint-plugin-react-refresh";\n\nexport defau

This keys are frozen.\n\nThis is an object. Keys are the type of [ESTree] nodes. Their values are an array of property names which have child nodes.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nconsole.log(evk.KEYS.AssignmentExpression) // ‚Üí ["left", "right"]\n```\n\n### evk.getKeys(node)\n\n> type: `(node: object) => string[]`\n\nGet the visitor keys of a given AST node.\n\nThis is similar to `Object.keys(node)` of ES Standard, but some keys are excluded: `parent`, `leadingComments`, `trailingComments`, and names which start with `_`.\n\nThis will be used to traverse unknown nodes.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nconst node = {\n    type: "AssignmentExpression",\n    left: { type: "Identifier", name: "foo" },\n    right: { type: "Literal", value: 0 }\n}\nconsole.log(evk.getKeys(node)) // ‚Üí ["type", "left", "right"]\n```\n\n### evk.unionWith(additionalKeys)\n\n> type: `(additionalKeys: object) => { [type: string]: string[] \| undefined }`\n\nMake the union set with `evk.KEYS` and the given keys.\n\n- The order of keys is, `additionalKeys` is at first, then `evk.KEYS` is concatenated after that.\n- It removes duplicated keys

Espree is now built on top of [Acorn](https://github.com/ternjs/acorn), which has a modular architecture that allows extension of core functionality. The goal of Espree is to produce output that is similar to Esprima with a similar API so that it can be used in place of Esprima.\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall:\n\n```\nnpm i espree\n```\n\nTo use in an ESM file:\n\n```js\nimport * as espree from "espree";\n\nconst ast = espree.parse(code);\n```\n\nTo use in a Common JS file:\n\n```js\nconst espree = require("espree");\n\nconst ast = espree.parse(code);\n```\n\n## API\n\n### `parse()`\n\n`parse` parses the given code and returns a abstract syntax tree (AST). It takes two parameters.\n\n- `code` [string]() - the code which needs to be parsed.\n- `options (Optional)` [Object]() - read more about this [here](#options).\n\n```js\nimport * as espree from "espree";\n\nconst ast = espree.parse(code);\n```\n\n**Example :**\n\n```js\nconst ast = espree.parse('let foo = "bar"', { ecmaVersion: 6 });\nconsole.log(ast);\n```\n\n<details><summary>Output</summary>\n<p>\n\n```\nNode {\n  type: 'Program',\n  start: 0,\n  end: 15,\n  body: [\n    Node {\n      type: 'VariableDeclaration',\n      start: 0,\n      end: 15,\n      declarations: [Array],\n      kind: 'let'\n    }\n  ],\n  sourceType: 'script'\n}\n```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n### `tokenize()`\n\n`tokenize` return

FILE:README.md|### Estraverse [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/estools/estraverse.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/estools/estraverse)\n\nEstraverse ([estraverse](http://github.com/estools/estraverse)) is\n[ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)\ntraversal functions from [esmangle project](http://github.com/estools/esmangle).\n\n### Documentation\n\nYou can find usage docs at [wiki page](https://github.com/estools/estraverse/wiki/Usage).\n\n### Example Usage\n\nThe following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.\n\n```javascript\nestraverse.traverse(ast, {\n    enter: function (node, parent) {\n        if (node.type == 'FunctionExpression' \|\| node.type == 'FunctionDeclaration')\n            return estraverse.VisitorOption.Skip;\n    },\n    leave: function (node, parent) {\n        if (node.type == 'VariableDeclarator')\n          console.log(node.id.name);\n    }\n});\n```\n\nWe can use `this.skip`, `this.remove` and `this.break` functions instead of using Skip, Remove and Break.\n\n```javascript\nestraverse.traverse(ast, {\n    enter: function (node) {\n        this.break();\n    }\n});\n```\n\nAnd estraverse provides `estraverse.replace` function. When returning node from `enter`/`leave`, current node is replaced with it.\n\n```javascript\nresult = estraverse.replace(tree, {\n    enter: function (node) {\n        // Replace it with replaced.\n        if (node.type === 'Literal')\n            return replaced;\n    }\n});\n```\n\nBy passing `visitor.keys` mapping, we can extend estraverse traversing functionality.\n\n```javascript\n// This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.\nvar tree = {\n    type: 'TestExpression',\n\n    // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.\n    argument: {\n        type: 'Literal',\n        value: 20\n    },\n\n    // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.\n    extended: true\n};\nestraverse.traverse(tree, {\n    enter: function (node) { },\n\n    // Extend

FILE:README.md|# fast-json-stable-stringify\n\nDeterministic `JSON.stringify()` - a faster version of [@substack](https://github.com/substack)'s json-stable-strigify without [jsonify](https://github.com/substack/jsonify).\n\nYou can also pass in a custom comparison function.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/epoberezkin/fast-json-stable-stringify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/epoberezkin/fast-json-stable-stringify)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/epoberezkin/fast-json-stable-stringify/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/epoberezkin/fast-json-stable-stringify?branch=master)\n\n# example\n\n``` js\nvar stringify = require('fast-json-stable-stringify');\nvar obj = { c: 8, b: [{z:6,y:5,x:4},7], a: 3 };\nconsole.log(stringify(obj));\n```\n\noutput:\n\n```\n{"a":3,"b":[{"x":4,"y":5,"z":6},7],"c":8}\n```\n\n\n# methods\n\n``` js\nvar stringify = require('fast-json-stable-stringify')\n```\n\n## var str = stringify(obj, opts)\n\nReturn a deterministic stringified string `str` from the object `obj`.\n\n\n## options\n\n### cmp\n\nIf `opts` is given, you can supply an `opts.cmp` to have a custom comparison\nfunction for object keys. Your function `opts.cmp` is called with these\nparameters:\n\n``` js\nopts.cmp({ key: akey, value: avalue }, { key: bkey, value: bvalue })\n```\n\nFor example, to sort on the object key names in reverse order you could write:\n\n``` js\nvar stringify = require('fast-json-stable-stringify');\n\nvar obj = { c: 8, b: [{z:6,y:5,x:4},7], a: 3 };\nvar s = stringify(obj, function (a, b) {\n    return a.key < b.key ? 1 : -1;\n});\nconsole.log(s);\n```\n\nwhich results in the output string:\n\n```\n{"c":8,"b":[{"z":6,"y":5,"x":4},7],"a":3}\n```\n\nOr if you wanted to sort on the object values in reverse order, you could write:\n\n```\nvar stringify = require('fast-json-stable-stringify');\n\nvar obj = { d: 6, c: 5, b: [{z:3,y:2,x:1},9], a: 10 };\nvar s = stringify(obj, function (a, b) {\n    return a.value < b.value ? 1 : -1;\n});\nconsole.log(s);\n```\n\nwhi

FILE:README.md|# fs.realpath\n\nA backwards-compatible fs.realpath for Node v6 and above\n\nIn Node v6, the JavaScript implementation of fs.realpath was replaced\nwith a faster (but less resilient) native implementation.  That raises\nnew and platform-specific errors and cannot handle long or excessively\nsymlink-looping paths.\n\nThis module handles those cases by detecting the new errors and\nfalling back to the JavaScript implementation.  On versions of Node\nprior to v6, it has no effect.\n\n## USAGE\n\n```js\nvar rp = require('fs.realpath')\n\n// async version\nrp.realpath(someLongAndLoopingPath, function (er, real) {\n  // the ELOOP was handled, but it was a bit slower\n})\n\n// sync version\nvar real = rp.realpathSync(someLongAndLoopingPath)\n\n// monkeypatch at your own risk!\n// This replaces the fs.realpath/fs.realpathSync builtins\nrp.monkeypatch()\n\n// un-do the monkeypatching\nrp.unmonkeypatch()\n```\n

FILE:README.md|# gensync\n\nThis module allows for developers to write common code that can share\nimplementation details, hiding whether an underlying request happens\nsynchronously or asynchronously. This is in contrast with many current Node\nAPIs which explicitly implement the same API twice, once with calls to\nsynchronous functions, and once with asynchronous functions.\n\nTake for example `fs.readFile` and `fs.readFileSync`, if you're writing an API\nthat loads a file and then performs a synchronous operation on the data, it\ncan be frustrating to maintain two parallel functions.\n\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nconst fs = require("fs");\nconst gensync = require("gensync");\n\nconst readFile = gensync({\n  sync: fs.readFileSync,\n  errback: fs.readFile,\n});\n\nconst myOperation = gensync(function* (filename) {\n  const code = yield* readFile(filename, "utf8");\n\n  return "// some custom prefix\n" + code;\n});\n\n// Load and add the prefix synchronously:\nconst result = myOperation.sync("./some-file.js");\n\n// Load and add the prefix asynchronously with promises:\nmyOperation.async("./some-file.js").then(result => {\n\n});\n\n// Load and add the prefix asynchronously with promises:\nmyOperation.errback("./some-file.js", (err, result) => {\n\n});\n```\n\nThis could even be exposed as your official API by doing\n```js\n// Using the common 'Sync' suffix for sync functions, and 'Async' suffix for\n// promise-returning versions.\nexports.myOperationSync = myOperation.sync;\nexports.myOperationAsync = myOperation.async;\nexports.myOperation = myOperation.errback;\n```\nor potentially expose one of the async versions as the default, with a\n`.sync` property on the function to expose the synchronous version.\n```js\nmodule.exports = myOperation.errback;\nmodule.exports.sync = myOperation.sync;\n````\n\n\n## API\n\n### gensync(generatorFnOrOptions)\n\nReturns a function that can be "await"-ed in another `gensync` generator\nfunction, or executed via\n\n* `.sync(...args)` - Returns the computed value, or throws.\n* `.async(...args)` -

FILE:readme.md|# globals\n\n> Global identifiers from different JavaScript environments\n\nIt's just a [JSON file](globals.json), so use it in any environment.\n\nThis package is used by ESLint.\n\n**This package [no longer accepts](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globals/issues/82) new environments. If you need it for ESLint, just [create a plugin](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-plugins#environments-in-plugins).**\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install globals\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst globals = require('globals');\n\nconsole.log(globals.browser);\n/*\n{\n	addEventListener: false,\n	applicationCache: false,\n	ArrayBuffer: false,\n	atob: false,\n	‚Ä¶\n}\n*/\n```\n\nEach global is given a value of `true` or `false`. A value of `true` indicates that the variable may be overwritten. A value of `false` indicates that the variable should be considered read-only. This information is used by static analysis tools to flag incorrect behavior. We assume all variables should be `false` unless we hear otherwise.\n\nFor Node.js this package provides two sets of globals:\n\n- `globals.nodeBuiltin`: Globals available to all code running in Node.js.\n	These will usually be available as properties on the `global` object and include `process`, `Buffer`, but not CommonJS arguments like `require`.\n	See: https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html\n- `globals.node`: A combination of the globals from `nodeBuiltin` plus all CommonJS arguments ("CommonJS module scope").\n	See: https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_the_module_scope\n\nWhen analyzing code that is known to run outside of a CommonJS wrapper, for example, JavaScript modules, `nodeBuiltin` can find accidental CommonJS references.\n

FILE:README.md|# Graphemer: Unicode Character Splitter ü™ì\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis library continues the work of [Grapheme Splitter](https://github.com/orling/grapheme-splitter) and supports the following unicode versions:\n\n- Unicode 15 and below `[v1.4.0]`\n- Unicode 14 and below `[v1.3.0]`\n- Unicode 13 and below `[v1.1.0]`\n- Unicode 11 and below `[v1.0.0]` (Unicode 10 supported by `grapheme-splitter`)\n\nIn JavaScript there is not always a one-to-one relationship between string characters and what a user would call a separate visual "letter". Some symbols are represented by several characters. This can cause issues when splitting strings and inadvertently cutting a multi-char letter in half, or when you need the actual number of letters in a string.\n\nFor example, emoji characters like "üå∑","üéÅ","üí©","üòú" and "üëç" are represented by two JavaScript characters each (high surrogate and low surrogate). That is,\n\n```javascript\n'üå∑'.length == 2;\n```\n\nThe combined emoji are even longer:\n\n```javascript\n'üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà'.length == 6;\n```\n\nWhat's more, some languages often include combining marks - characters that are used to modify the letters before them. Common examples are the German letter √º and the Spanish letter √±. Sometimes they can be represented alternatively both as a single character and as a letter + combining mark, with both forms equally valid:\n\n```javascript\nvar two = 'nÃÉ'; // unnormalized two-char n+‚óåÃÉ, i.e. "\u006E\u0303";\nvar one = '√±'; // normalized single-char, i.e. "\u00F1"\n\nconsole.log(one != two); // prints 'true'\n```\n\nUnicode normalization, as performed by the popular punycode.js library or ECMAScript 6's String.normalize, can **sometimes** fix those differences and turn two-char sequences into single characters. But it is **not** enough in all cases. Some languages like Hindi make extensive use of combining marks on their letters, that have no dedicated single-codepoint Unicode sequences, due to the sheer number of possible combinations.\nFor example, the Hindi

FILE:README.md|iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other has

FILE:README.md|Browser-friendly inheritance fully compatible with standard node.js\n[inherits](http://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inherits_constructor_superconstructor).\n\nThis package exports standard `inherits` from node.js `util` module in\nnode environment, but also provides alternative browser-friendly\nimplementation through [browser\nfield](https://gist.github.com/shtylman/4339901). Alternative\nimplementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone\nmodule to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old\nbrowsers with no `Object.create` support.\n\nWhile keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`\nimplementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as\n[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not\ninclude full `util` package to your client code if all you need is\njust `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`\npackage is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need\nfrom it.\n\nIt's recommended to use this package instead of\n`require('util').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used\nnot only in node.js but in browser too.\n\n## usage\n\n```js\nvar inherits = require('inherits');\n// then use exactly as the standard one\n```\n\n## note on version ~1.0\n\nVersion ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible\nneither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.\n\nIf you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be\ncareful:\n\n* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing\n  superclass\n* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any\n  existing fields on it\n

FILE:CHANGELOG.md|### Version 4.0.0 (2018-01-28) ###\n\n- Added: Support for ES2018. The only change needed was recognizing the `s`\n  regex flag.\n- Changed: _All_ tokens returned by the `matchToToken` function now have a\n  `closed` property. It is set to `undefined` for the tokens where ‚Äúclosed‚Äù\n  doesn‚Äôt make sense. This means that all tokens objects have the same shape,\n  which might improve performance.\n\nThese are the breaking changes:\n\n- `'/a/s'.match(jsTokens)` no longer returns `['/', 'a', '/', 's']`, but\n  `['/a/s']`. (There are of course other variations of this.)\n- Code that rely on some token objects not having the `closed` property could\n  now behave differently.\n\n\n### Version 3.0.2 (2017-06-28) ###\n\n- No code changes. Just updates to the readme.\n\n\n### Version 3.0.1 (2017-01-30) ###\n\n- Fixed: ES2015 unicode escapes with more than 6 hex digits are now matched\n  correctly.\n\n\n### Version 3.0.0 (2017-01-11) ###\n\nThis release contains one breaking change, that should [improve performance in\nV8][v8-perf]:\n\n> So how can you, as a JavaScript developer, ensure that your RegExps are fast?\n> If you are not interested in hooking into RegExp internals, make sure that\n> neither the RegExp instance, nor its prototype is modified in order to get the\n> best performance:\n>\n> ```js\n> var re = /./g;\n> re.exec('');  // Fast path.\n> re.new_property = 'slow';\n> ```\n\nThis module used to export a single regex, with `.matchToToken` bolted\non, just like in the above example.

FILE:README.md|Overview [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lydell/js-tokens.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lydell/js-tokens)\n========\n\nA regex that tokenizes JavaScript.\n\n```js\nvar jsTokens = require("js-tokens").default\n\nvar jsString = "var foo=opts.foo;\n..."\n\njsString.match(jsTokens)\n// ["var", " ", "foo", "=", "opts", ".", "foo", ";", "\n", ...]\n```\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n`npm install js-tokens`\n\n```js\nimport jsTokens from "js-tokens"\n// or:\nvar jsTokens = require("js-tokens").default\n```\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n### `jsTokens` ###\n\nA regex with the `g` flag that matches JavaScript tokens.\n\nThe regex _always_ matches, even invalid JavaScript and the empty string.\n\nThe next match is always directly after the previous.\n\n### `var token = matchToToken(match)` ###\n\n```js\nimport {matchToToken} from "js-tokens"\n// or:\nvar matchToToken = require("js-tokens").matchToToken\n```\n\nTakes a `match` returned by `jsTokens.exec(string)`, and returns a `{type:\nString, value: String}` object. The following types are available:\n\n- string\n- comment\n- regex\n- number\n- name\n- punctuator\n- whitespace\n- invalid\n\nMulti-line comments and strings also have a `closed` property indicating if the\ntoken was closed or not (see below).\n\nComments and strings both come in several flavors. To distinguish them, check if\nthe token starts with `//`, `/*`, `'`, `"` or `` ` ``.\n\nNames are ECMAScript IdentifierNames, that is, including both identifiers and\nkeywords. You may use [is-keyword-js] to tell them apart.\n\nWhitespace includes both line terminators and other whitespace.\n\n[is-keyword-js]: https://github.com/crissdev/is-keyword-js\n\n\nECMAScript support\n==================\n\nThe intention is to always support the latest ECMAScript version whose feature\nset has been finalized.\n\nIf adding support for a newer version requires changes, a new version with a\nmajor verion bump will be released.\n\nCurrently, ECMAScript 2018 is supported.\n\n\nInvalid code handling\n==================

FILE:README.md|JS-YAML - YAML 1.2 parser / writer for JavaScript\n=================================================\n\n[![CI](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/actions)\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/js-yaml.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/js-yaml)\n\n__[Online Demo](http://nodeca.github.com/js-yaml/)__\n\n\nThis is an implementation of [YAML](http://yaml.org/), a human-friendly data\nserialization language. Started as [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/) port, it was\ncompletely rewritten from scratch. Now it's very fast, and supports 1.2 spec.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n### YAML module for node.js\n\n```\nnpm install js-yaml\n```\n\n\n### CLI executable\n\nIf you want to inspect your YAML files from CLI, install js-yaml globally:\n\n```\nnpm install -g js-yaml\n```\n\n#### Usage\n\n```\nusage: js-yaml [-h] [-v] [-c] [-t] file\n\nPositional arguments:\n  file           File with YAML document(s)\n\nOptional arguments:\n  -h, --help     Show this help message and exit.\n  -v, --version  Show program's version number and exit.\n  -c, --compact  Display errors in compact mode\n  -t, --trace    Show stack trace on error\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\nHere we cover the most 'useful' methods. If you need advanced details (creating\nyour own tags), see [examples](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/tree/master/examples)\nfor more info.\n\n``` javascript\nconst yaml = require('js-yaml');\nconst fs   = require('fs');\n\n// Get document, or throw exception on error\ntry {\n  const doc = yaml.load(fs.readFileSync('/home/ixti/example.yml', 'utf8'));\n  console.log(doc);\n} catch (e) {\n  console.log(e);\n}\n```\n\n\n### load (string [ , options ])\n\nParses `string` as single YAML document. Returns either a\nplain object, a string, a number, `null` or `undefined`, or throws `YAMLException` on error. By default, does\nnot support regexps, functions and undefined.\n\noptions:\n\n- `filename` _(default: null)_ - string to be used as a file path in\n  error/warn

FILE:README.md|# json-schema-traverse\nTraverse JSON Schema passing each schema object to callback\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/epoberezkin/json-schema-traverse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/epoberezkin/json-schema-traverse)\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/json-schema-traverse.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-schema-traverse)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/epoberezkin/json-schema-traverse/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/epoberezkin/json-schema-traverse?branch=master)\n\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install json-schema-traverse\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nconst traverse = require('json-schema-traverse');\nconst schema = {\n  properties: {\n    foo: {type: 'string'},\n    bar: {type: 'integer'}\n  }\n};\n\ntraverse(schema, {cb});\n// cb is called 3 times with:\n// 1. root schema\n// 2. {type: 'string'}\n// 3. {type: 'integer'}\n\n// Or:\n\ntraverse(schema, {cb: {pre, post}});\n// pre is called 3 times with:\n// 1. root schema\n// 2. {type: 'string'}\n// 3. {type: 'integer'}\n//\n// post is called 3 times with:\n// 1. {type: 'string'}\n// 2. {type: 'integer'}\n// 3. root schema\n\n```\n\nCallback function `cb` is called for each schema object (not including draft-06 boolean schemas), including the root schema, in pre-order traversal. Schema references ($ref) are not resolved, they are passed as is.  Alternatively, you can pass a `{pre, post}` object as `cb`, and then `pre` will be called before traversing child elements, and `post` will be called after all child elements have been traversed.\n\nCallback is passed these parameters:\n\n- _schema_: the current schema object\n- _JSON pointer_: from the root schema to the current schema object\n- _root schema_: the schema passed to `traverse` object\n- _parent JSON pointer_: from the root schema to the parent schema object (see below)\n- _parent keyword_: the keyword inside which this schema appears (e.g. `properties`, `anyOf`, etc.)\n- _parent schema_: not necessarily parent object/array; in

FILE:readme.markdown|# json-stable-stringify\n\nThis is the same as https://github.com/substack/json-stable-stringify but it doesn't depend on libraries without licenses (jsonify).\n\ndeterministic version of `JSON.stringify()` so you can get a consistent hash\nfrom stringified results\n\nYou can also pass in a custom comparison function.\n\n[![browser support](https://ci.testling.com/substack/json-stable-stringify.png)](https://ci.testling.com/substack/json-stable-stringify)\n\n[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/substack/json-stable-stringify.png)](http://travis-ci.org/substack/json-stable-stringify)\n\n# example\n\n``` js\nvar stringify = require('json-stable-stringify');\nvar obj = { c: 8, b: [{z:6,y:5,x:4},7], a: 3 };\nconsole.log(stringify(obj));\n```\n\noutput:\n\n```\n{"a":3,"b":[{"x":4,"y":5,"z":6},7],"c":8}\n```\n\n# methods\n\n``` js\nvar stringify = require('json-stable-stringify')\n```\n\n## var str = stringify(obj, opts)\n\nReturn a deterministic stringified string `str` from the object `obj`.\n\n## options\n\n### cmp\n\nIf `opts` is given, you can supply an `opts.cmp` to have a custom comparison\nfunction for object keys. Your function `opts.cmp` is called with these\nparameters:\n\n``` js\nopts.cmp({ key: akey, value: avalue }, { key: bkey, value: bvalue })\n```\n\nFor example, to sort on the object key names in reverse order you could write:\n\n``` js\nvar stringify = require('json-stable-stringify');\n\nvar obj = { c: 8, b: [{z:6,y:5,x:4},7], a: 3 };\nvar s = stringify(obj, function (a, b) {\n    return a.key < b.key ? 1 : -1;\n});\nconsole.log(s);\n```\n\nwhich results in the output string:\n\n```\n{"c":8,"b":[{"z":6,"y":5,"x":4},7],"a":3}\n```\n\nOr if you wanted to sort on the object values in reverse order, you could write:\n\n```\nvar stringify = require('json-stable-stringify');\n\nvar obj = { d: 6, c: 5, b: [{z:3,y:2,x:1},9], a: 10 };\nvar s = stringify(obj, function (a, b) {\n    return a.value < b.value ? 1 : -1;\n});\nconsole.log(s);\n```\n\nwhich outputs:\n\n```\n{"d":6,"c":5,"b":[{"z":3,"y":2,

Works just like [envify](https://github.com/hughsk/envify) but much faster.\n\n## Gotchas\n\n* Doesn't handle broken syntax.\n* Doesn't look inside embedded expressions in template strings.\n  - **this won't work:**\n  ```js\n  console.log(`the current env is ${process.env.NODE_ENV}`);\n  ```\n* Doesn't replace oddly-spaced or oddly-commented expressions.\n  - **this won't work:**\n  ```js\n  console.log(process./*won't*/env./*work*/NODE_ENV);\n  ```\n\n## Usage/Options\n\nloose-envify has the exact same interface as [envify](https://github.com/hughsk/envify), including the CLI.\n\n## Benchmark\n\n```\nenvify:\n\n  $ for i in {1..5}; do node bench/bench.js 'envify'; done\n  708ms\n  727ms\n  791ms\n  719ms\n  720ms\n\nloose-envify:\n\n  $ for i in {1..5}; do node bench/bench.js '../'; done\n  51ms\n  52ms\n  52ms\n  52ms\n  52ms\n```\n

Not setting this is kind of\n  silly, since that's the whole purpose of this lib, but it defaults\n  to `Infinity`.  Setting it to a non-number or negative number will\n  throw a `TypeError`.  Setting it to 0 makes it be `Infinity`.\n* `maxAge` Maximum age in ms.  Items are not pro-actively pruned out\n  as they age, but if you try to get an item that is too old, it'll\n  drop it and return undefined instead of giving it to you.\n  Set

FILE:README.md|# minimatch\n\nA minimal matching utility.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch)\n\n\nThis is the matching library used internally by npm.\n\nIt works by converting glob expressions into JavaScript `RegExp`\nobjects.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar minimatch = require("minimatch")\n\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.foo") // true!\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.bar") // false!\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.+(bar\|foo)", { debug: true }) // true, and noisy!\n```\n\n## Features\n\nSupports these glob features:\n\n* Brace Expansion\n* Extended glob matching\n* "Globstar" `**` matching\n\nSee:\n\n* `man sh`\n* `man bash`\n* `man 3 fnmatch`\n* `man 5 gitignore`\n\n## Minimatch Class\n\nCreate a minimatch object by instantiating the `minimatch.Minimatch` class.\n\n```javascript\nvar Minimatch = require("minimatch").Minimatch\nvar mm = new Minimatch(pattern, options)\n```\n\n### Properties\n\n* `pattern` The original pattern the minimatch object represents.\n* `options` The options supplied to the constructor.\n* `set` A 2-dimensional array of regexp or string expressions.\n  Each row in the\n  array corresponds to a brace-expanded pattern.  Each item in the row\n  corresponds to a single path-part.  For example, the pattern\n  `{a,b/c}/d` would expand to a set of patterns like:\n\n        [ [ a, d ]\n        , [ b, c, d ] ]\n\n    If a portion of the pattern doesn't have any "magic" in it\n    (that is, it's something like `"foo"` rather than `fo*o?`), then it\n    will be left as a string rather than converted to a regular\n    expression.\n\n* `regexp` Created by the `makeRe` method.  A single regular expression\n  expressing the entire pattern.  This is useful in cases where you wish\n  to use the pattern somewhat like `fnmatch(3)` with `FNM_PATH` enabled.\n* `negate` True if the pattern is negated.\n* `comment` True if the pattern is a comment.\n* `empty` True if the pattern is `""`.\n\n### Methods\n\n* `makeRe` Generate the `regexp` member if necessary

[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device\n2. Link the package to the global module directory: `npm link`\n3. Within the module you want to test your local development instance of ms, just link it to the dependencies: `npm link ms`. Instead of the default one from npm, Node.js will now use your clone of ms!\n\nAs always, you can run the tests using: `npm test`\n

FILE:README.md|# once\n\nOnly call a function once.\n\n## usage\n\n```javascript\nvar once = require('once')\n\nfunction load (file, cb) {\n  cb = once(cb)\n  loader.load('file')\n  loader.once('load', cb)\n  loader.once('error', cb)\n}\n```\n\nOr add to the Function.prototype in a responsible way:\n\n```javascript\n// only has to be done once\nrequire('once').proto()\n\nfunction load (file, cb) {\n  cb = cb.once()\n  loader.load('file')\n  loader.once('load', cb)\n  loader.once('error', cb)\n}\n```\n\nIronically, the prototype feature makes this module twice as\ncomplicated as necessary.\n\nTo check whether you function has been called, use `fn.called`. Once the\nfunction is called for the first time the return value of the original\nfunction is saved in `fn.value` and subsequent calls will continue to\nreturn this value.\n\n```javascript\nvar once = require('once')\n\nfunction load (cb) {\n  cb = once(cb)\n  var stream = createStream()\n  stream.once('data', cb)\n  stream.once('end', function () {\n    if (!cb.called) cb(new Error('not found'))\n  })\n}\n```\n\n## `once.strict(func)`\n\nThrow an error if the function is called twice.\n\nSome functions are expected to be called only once. Using `once` for them would\npotentially hide logical errors.\n\nIn the example below, the `greet` function has to call the callback only once:\n\n```javascript\nfunction greet (name, cb) {\n  // return is missing from the if statement\n  // when no name is passed, the callback is called twice\n  if (!name) cb('Hello anonymous')\n  cb('Hello ' + name)\n}\n\nfunction log (msg) {\n  console.log(msg)\n}\n\n// this will print 'Hello anonymous' but the logical error will be missed\ngreet(null, once(msg))\n\n// once.strict will print 'Hello anonymous' and throw an error when the callback will be called the second time\ngreet(null, once.strict(msg))\n```\n
